## What does it do?

This is an application allows users to edit files over a WevDAV connection and tracks those changes via automatic git commits (file versioning).
It can be used to store the files edited with ediarum.BASE.edit in a git repository, e.g. GitHub or GitLab.

ediarum.WEBDAV includes the following features:

* User Management (Create Users, Manage Passwords, Add to Projects)
* Project Management (Create Projects, Add git repositories to Projects)
* Configure a WevDAV connection to multiple different Projects
* When files are edited, the user can push those files to an exist-db
* When files are edited, the user can push those files to ediarum.BACKEND (still in development).
